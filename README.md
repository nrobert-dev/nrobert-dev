### Welcome to my profile! 

I'm a software engineer currently residing in Romania. I currently work as a Front-End Technical Lead for [Toluna.com](https://tolunacorporate.com/) in **Timisoara**. You can find out more about me [here](https://robertnc.com). I mostly specialize in front-end work.

My meta build of choice is:
 - For Front-End (React, Typescript, Redux+Saga, Redux-Toolkit/Query)
 - For Back-End (either NodeJS or .NET)
 - For Game Development (Unity + .NET)
 

### Personal Summary
 - I'm a front-end software engineer at heart but I like to experiment regurarly with other programming languages and systems (such as Rust).
 - I have a small blog where I talk about my experiments : [Master of Some Blog](https://blog.robertnc.com/) 
 - During my free time I also do game development and 3D Modelling [Digital Art Portfolio](https://www.artstation.com/thunderent). I have worked on two released games so far : [Merchant Run](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twotwou.MerchantRun) and [Dream of Me](https://thunderent.itch.io/dream-of-me)
 - My main personal project is [Nootify API](https://nootify.onrender.com/), an API for sending and managing notifications. It's still in Beta.

### Welcome to my profile, adventurer! ⭐️

I'm a Full-Stack developer from Romania. I currently work as a Front-End Technical Lead for [Toluna.com](https://tolunacorporate.com/) in **Timisoara**. You can find out more about me [here](https://robertnc.com)

My meta build of choice is:
 - For Front-End (React 💚, Typescript 💙, Redux+Saga 💛)
 - For Back-End (either NodeJS 💚 or .NET 💙)
 

### Personal Summary

### Welcome to my profile, adventurer! ⭐️

I'm a Full-Stack developer from Romania. I currently work as a Front-End Technical Lead for [Toluna.com](https://tolunacorporate.com/) in **Timisoara**.

My meta build of choice is:
 - For Front-End (React 💚, Typescript 💙, Redux+Saga 💛)
 - For Back-End (either NodeJS 💚 or .NET 💙)
 
As you'll see in my repositories I like to experiment with Rust from time to time.

I have a small blog where I talk about my experiments : 🚀 [Master of Some Blog](https://blog.robertnc.com/) 🚀

During my free time I also do game development and 3D Modelling ⭐️ [Digital Art Portfolio](https://www.artstation.com/thunderent) ⭐️

Feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:robert.nechitelea@gmail.com) for help, collabs or work.

✨🚀✨👨🏻‍🚀✨🖖✨
